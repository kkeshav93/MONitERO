# Spent and risky transaction outputs
Monero's untraceability is based on the sampling of decoy inputs for each real transaction input.
If a decoy input is a reference to an output which is known to be spent, it does not contribute to the size of the anonymity set of the real input.
To prevent the sampling of spent outputs as decoys, the blackballing tool (released together with Monero v.0.12) can be used.

Lists of outputs which should be avoided can be obtained by following the links (which will be added soon).

* Provably spent: [Link](#TODO)
* (Probably) spent on a forked chain: [Link](#TODO)
* At risk of being identified as spent: [Link](#TODO)

These files cannot be included in the repo due to their size.
